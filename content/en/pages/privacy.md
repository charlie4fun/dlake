## General
We have done our best to create a simple, transparent privacy policy. **Our aim is to collect and store as little data as possible.**

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, process, store, and protect any personal information you share with us while using our website (ci-cloud.de, hereinafter referred to as "website"), in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the Telecommunication Digital Services Data Protection Act (TDDDG) and other applicable German data protection laws.

This site is statically generated and served as HTML. Fundamentally this means there is very little surface area for this site to be hacked or compromised. It does not require a database or backend server to process and render documents. Technically there is still a webserver, but it serves pre-rendered documents generated at build time.

### Definitions
Our privacy policy should be simple and easy to understand for everyone. In this data protection declaration, the official terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are generally used. The official definitions are explained in Art. 4 GDPR.

## Services We Use
### Hosting
Our website is hosted by an external service provider, GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc. (GitHub B.V. Prins Bernhardplein 200, Amsterdam 1097JB The Netherlands and GitHub, Inc. 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St. San Francisco, CA 94107 United States), located in the United States. Hosting on GitHub Pages allows us to maintain a stable, secure, and optimized website for our users. While we manage the content displayed on our site, certain data collected through the website (such as IP addresses and browsing behavior) may be processed by GitHub as part of its hosting services.

#### Data Processing by GitHub
GitHub may collect and process certain technical data (e.g., IP addresses, log files) as part of their infrastructure services. This data may be automatically logged by GitHub to maintain and secure their network, optimize the hosting service, and fulfill legal obligations.

#### Data Transfer to Third Countries
As GitHub is based in the United States, personal data may be transferred to and processed in the United States. GitHub complies with GDPR through the implementation of adequate safeguards, including standard contractual clauses where applicable. For more information on GitHub’s data processing practices, please review GitHub’s [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### Security Measures
GitHub implements various technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data on their servers. However, Cirro Cloud GmbH remains responsible for the management of website content and the protection of data shared through our site.

Any data you submit in this form may be shared with 3rd party service providers. These providers include, but are not limited to:

Your data will be deleted after your request has been processed, provided there are no legal storage requirements to the contrary. In the case of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR, you can object to the processing of your personal data at any time. 

### Google Ads
We use this service on our website.
The service allows us to promote our offerings on external websites through advertisements and analyze the effectiveness of individual advertising campaigns. These ads are delivered via so-called "AdServers" provided by the service provider. To measure the success of our campaigns, we use AdServer cookies that collect certain parameters, such as the number of ad impressions or user clicks.
If you reach our website through one of these ads, the service stores a cookie on your device. This cookie is not intended to personally identify you. Typically, it stores analytical data such as the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions), and opt-out information (if the user no longer wishes to receive ads).
These cookies enable the provider to recognize your web browser. If a user visits specific pages of our website and the stored cookie has not yet expired, the provider and we can detect that the user has clicked on an ad and been redirected to our site. Each advertiser is assigned a unique cookie, meaning cookies cannot be tracked across different advertisers' websites.
We do not collect or process any personal data in these advertising measures. We only receive anonymized statistical evaluations from the provider, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of our ads. We do not obtain any further data from the use of advertising materials, particularly not information that could identify individual users.
By using this marketing tool, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the provider's server. We have no control over the extent or further use of the data collected by the provider. According to our knowledge, the provider receives information that you have accessed a specific part of our website or clicked on one of our ads. If you have an account with the provider and are logged in, the provider may associate your visit with your user account. Even if you are not registered or logged in, the provider may still be able to determine and store your IP address.
We use this service for marketing and optimization purposes, particularly to deliver relevant and engaging advertisements, improve our offerings, and make our website more appealing while avoiding unnecessary ads.
Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR (consent).

### Google Analytics
We use this service on our website.
Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR (consent).
This service uses cookies—small text files stored on your device that enable an analysis of your use of our website. The information generated by the cookie about your website usage is generally transmitted to and stored on a server of the provider. If IP anonymization is activated on the website ("IP anonymization"), your IP address will first be truncated by the provider within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a server outside the EU and shortened there.
The provider of this service will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our website, compile reports on website activity, and provide other services related to website and internet usage. Pseudonymous user profiles may be created from the processed data. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other provider data.
We use this service to analyze how our website is used and to continuously improve individual features, offerings, and the overall user experience. By statistically evaluating user behavior, we can enhance our services and make them more relevant for you. The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
You can prevent cookies from being stored by adjusting the settings in your web browser. However, please note that this may limit your ability to use all functions of our website. If you want to prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by the provider, you can download and install the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
To ensure that the provider processes the transmitted data strictly in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with applicable data protection regulations, we have entered into a data processing agreement with the provider.

### Google Tag Manager
We use the service on our website.
The service allows us, as marketers, to manage website tags via an interface. The tool that implements the tags operates on a cookie-less domain and does not itself collect any personal data. The service triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. The service does not access this data. If a deactivation has been carried out at the domain or cookie level, it remains in effect for all tracking tags implemented with the service.

- **With Service Providers**: We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf.
- **For Legal Purposes**: We may share your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

## Your Rights
The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example:
- **Access**: Request access to your personal data.
- **Correction**: Request correction of your personal data.
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your personal data.
- **Data Portability**: Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
- **Withdraw Consent**: Withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on your consent to process your personal data.

Your rights in detail:
- **Right to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR:** You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information on the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h GDPR.
- **Right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR:** This right includes the rectification of inaccurate data and the completion of incomplete personal data.
- **Right to erasure in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR:** This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to request the erasure of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, if consent has been withdrawn or the initial processing took place without a legal basis. A detailed list of reasons can be found in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a to f GDPR. This “right to be forgotten” also corresponds to the controller's obligation under Art. 17 para. 2 GDPR to take reasonable measures to bring about the general erasure of data.
- **Right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR:** This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18 para. 1 lit. a to d.
- **Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR:** This regulates the basic right to receive your own data in a commonly used form and to transmit it to another controller. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract in accordance with Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and insofar as this is technically feasible.
- **Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR:** In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.
- **Right to “individual decision-making” pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR:** In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.
- **Further rights:** The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this is only possible or feasible with reasonable effort.</br>
At this point, we would like to draw your attention once again to your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.</br>
We would also like to draw your attention to your rights under Sections 32 et seq. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.
- **Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR:** You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates this regulation.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect your personal data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
