## Allgemeines
Wir haben unser Bestes getan, um eine einfache und transparente Datenschutzerklärung zu erstellen. **Unser Ziel ist es, so wenig Daten wie möglich zu erheben und zu speichern.**

Diese Datenschutzerklärung erläutert, wie wir personenbezogene Daten erheben, verarbeiten, speichern und schützen, die Sie uns beim Besuch unserer Website (ci-cloud.de, nachfolgend „Website“ genannt) zur Verfügung stellen – in voller Übereinstimmung mit der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO), dem Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG), dem Telekommunikation-Digitale-Dienste-Datenschutz-Gesetz (TDDDG) sowie weiteren anwendbaren deutschen Datenschutzgesetzen.

Diese Website wird statisch generiert und als HTML bereitgestellt. Das bedeutet grundsätzlich, dass es nur eine sehr geringe Angriffsfläche für Hacks oder Sicherheitsverletzungen gibt. Es wird weder eine Datenbank noch ein Backend-Server benötigt, um Inhalte zu verarbeiten oder darzustellen. Technisch gesehen gibt es zwar einen Webserver, dieser liefert jedoch lediglich vorab gerenderte Dokumente aus, die zur Build-Zeit erstellt wurden.

### Begriffsbestimmungen
Unsere Datenschutzerklärung soll für alle Nutzer leicht verständlich sein. In dieser Datenschutzerklärung werden in der Regel die offiziellen Begriffe der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) verwendet. Die offiziellen Definitionen sind in Art. 4 DSGVO erläutert.

## Services We Use
### Hosting
Our website is hosted by an external service provider, GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc. (GitHub B.V. Prins Bernhardplein 200, Amsterdam 1097JB The Netherlands and GitHub, Inc. 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St. San Francisco, CA 94107 United States), located in the United States.

In the case of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR, you can object to the processing of your personal data at any time. 

### Google Ads
We use this service on our website.
The service allows us to promote our offerings on external websites through advertisements and analyze the effectiveness of individual advertising campaigns. These ads are delivered via so-called "AdServers" provided by the service provider. To measure the success of our campaigns, we use AdServer cookies that collect certain parameters, such as the number of ad impressions or user clicks.
If you reach our website through one of these ads, the service stores a cookie on your device. This cookie is not intended to personally identify you. Typically, it stores analytical data such as the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions), and opt-out information (if the user no longer wishes to receive ads).
These cookies enable the provider to recognize your web browser. If a user visits specific pages of our website and the stored cookie has not yet expired, the provider and we can detect that the user has clicked on an ad and been redirected to our site. Each advertiser is assigned a unique cookie, meaning cookies cannot be tracked across different advertisers' websites.
We do not collect or process any personal data in these advertising measures. We only receive anonymized statistical evaluations from the provider, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of our ads. We do not obtain any further data from the use of advertising materials, particularly not information that could identify individual users.
By using this marketing tool, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the provider's server. We have no control over the extent or further use of the data collected by the provider. According to our knowledge, the provider receives information that you have accessed a specific part of our website or clicked on one of our ads. If you have an account with the provider and are logged in, the provider may associate your visit with your user account. Even if you are not registered or logged in, the provider may still be able to determine and store your IP address.
We use this service for marketing and optimization purposes, particularly to deliver relevant and engaging advertisements, improve our offerings, and make our website more appealing while avoiding unnecessary ads.

### Google Analytics
We use this service on our website.
Legal basis: Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR (consent).
This service uses cookies—small text files stored on your device that enable an analysis of your use of our website. The information generated by the cookie about your website usage is generally transmitted to and stored on a server of the provider. If IP anonymization is activated on the website ("IP anonymization"), your IP address will first be truncated by the provider within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a server outside the EU and shortened there.
The provider of this service will use this information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our website, compile reports on website activity, and provide other services related to website and internet usage. Pseudonymous user profiles may be created from the processed data. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other provider data.
We use this service to analyze how our website is used and to continuously improve individual features, offerings, and the overall user experience. By statistically evaluating user behavior, we can enhance our services and make them more relevant for you. The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.
You can prevent cookies from being stored by adjusting the settings in your web browser. However, please note that this may limit your ability to use all functions of our website. If you want to prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by the provider, you can download and install the browser plugin available at the following link:
https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
To ensure that the provider processes the transmitted data strictly in accordance with our instructions and in compliance with applicable data protection regulations, we have entered into a data processing agreement with the provider.

### Google Tag Manager
We use the service on our website.
The service allows us, as marketers, to manage website tags via an interface. The tool that implements the tags operates on a cookie-less domain and does not itself collect any personal data. The service triggers other tags, which in turn may collect data. The service does not access this data. If a deactivation has been carried out at the domain or cookie level, it remains in effect for all tracking tags implemented with the service.

### Microsoft Clarity
We use this service on our website.
The service enables us to better understand how users interact with our website through features like session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics. This helps us identify usability issues, optimize user experience, and improve the overall functionality of our site.
Clarity uses cookies and other tracking technologies to collect data such as mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and interactions with page elements.

When you visit our website, Clarity may store a cookie on your device. This cookie is used solely for analytical purposes and does not personally identify you. It allows us to see aggregated data and analyze how different user groups interact with the website.
By using Clarity, your browser automatically connects to Microsoft servers. We have no control over the extent or specific use of the data collected by Microsoft. To our knowledge, Microsoft may receive information that you have accessed our website. If you have a Microsoft account and are logged in, Microsoft may be able to associate your visit with your account. Even without logging in, Microsoft may still collect and store certain technical data such as your IP address or device characteristics.

- **Contact Information**: Name, email address, mailing address, phone number.
- **Log Data**: Information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site.
- **Cookies**: Data files placed on your device or computer which often include an anonymous unique identifier.

## How We Use Your Information
We may use the information we collect for various purposes, including:
- **To Provide and Maintain the Site**: We use your personal data to provide you with access to our Site and to monitor and improve its performance.
- **To Send You Updates and Marketing Communications**: We may send you newsletters or marketing communications about our services.
- **To Comply With Legal Obligations**: We may use your information to comply with legal obligations, such as to respond to a subpoena or other legal request.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure
We may share your personal data with third parties in the following situations:
- **With Service Providers**: We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf.
- **For Legal Purposes**: We may share your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

## Your Rights
The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example:
- **Access**: Request access to your personal data.
- **Correction**: Request correction of your personal data.
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your personal data.
- **Data Portability**: Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
- **Withdraw Consent**: Withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on your consent to process your personal data.

Your rights in detail:
- **Right to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR:** You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information on the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h GDPR.
- **Right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR:** This right includes the rectification of inaccurate data and the completion of incomplete personal data.
- **Right to erasure in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR:** This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to request the erasure of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, if consent has been withdrawn or the initial processing took place without a legal basis. A detailed list of reasons can be found in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a to f GDPR. This “right to be forgotten” also corresponds to the controller's obligation under Art. 17 para. 2 GDPR to take reasonable measures to bring about the general erasure of data.
- **Right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR:** This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18 para. 1 lit. a to d.
- **Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR:** This regulates the basic right to receive your own data in a commonly used form and to transmit it to another controller. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract in accordance with Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and insofar as this is technically feasible.
- **Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR:** In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.
- **Right to “individual decision-making” pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR:** In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.
- **Further rights:** The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this is only possible or feasible with reasonable effort.</br>
At this point, we would like to draw your attention once again to your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.</br>
We would also like to draw your attention to your rights under Sections 32 et seq. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.
- **Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR:** You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates this regulation.
